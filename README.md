# React Draggable ToDo List with Edit and Delete functions as well.

The site is fully responsive(with Bootstrap) with color changing CSS animations as well as buttons. The draggable contents provide a user-friendly experience with beautiful colors. Each item also has a Delete and Edit button. Deleting will erase, Edition will enable you to edit the contents with autofocus on the input bar, so that the mouse will not have to be touched when editing.
